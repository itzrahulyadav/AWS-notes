# Object storage (Detailed Notes)

### Different type of storages

1.  Block Storage
      -  The storage is divided into small bits or bytes called blocks which have unique identifier.
      -  whenever any change is made instead of updating the entire storage,only the specific block
         is updated because of which this type of storages are very fast
      
      -  This are used for databases like relational database where individual pieces of file can be modified.

2.  File Storage
     -  This type of storage organizes the data into hierarichal manner into files and folders.
     -  Storage is divided into files,folders or directories and sub-directories.
   
3.  Object Storage
    -  The data called object is stored in flat structure called bucket.
    -  The key name prefixes,metadata and delimiters are used to organize data.

## Amazon S3(The infinite storage)
- AWS s3 is an object storage that can store virtually unlimited data into buckets.

#### Buckets

-  Buckets are containers that store objects.
-  1 - 100 buckets can be created per account,can be increased to 1000.
-  Features of buckets
    - buckets are owned by account and can't be transferred to other account.
    - buckets names are globally unique
    - buckets can't be renamed
    - bucket nesting is not allowed,unlimited objects can be stored
    - Conventions for naming buckets
           - names can be 3-63 chars long
           - can only contain lowercase letters,dots and hyphens (-)
           - start with lowercase letter or number
           - can't begin with xn--
           - not be formatted as IP address
           - only use dot if you are using the bucket for static site hosting.
          
 
 #### Introduction to objects

 - Objects are files and the metadata that describes the file.
 -  Max object size can be 5TB
 -  The key name uniquely identifies the object in the bucket. 
 -  Multiple variants of the object can be kept in the bucket using versioning.
              - Versioning is used to prevent unintended deletes
              - AWS provides unique version ID to each object uploaded.
 -  Value is the size of the object.
 -  Aws maintains object metadata such as creation date,size etc.
 -  Access to objects can be done using ACL and bucket policies.
 -  Tagging can be used to organize data
            -  A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource
            -  Tags consist of key and value pairs.
            -  Tags can be assigned to objects and buckets
            -  Max of 10 tags can be assigned to objects.    

#### Interacting with aws s3

-  We can interact with s3 using following ways:

      -  AWS management console:
            -  GUI view of s3
            -  maximum file size that can be uploaded are 160GB
      -   AWS CLI:
            -  used to manage buckets and objects using command Line
            -  operations can be performed using commands
      -   AWS SDK:
            -  allows us to manage s3 using programming languages
            -  uses s3 api to send requests

-  s3 supports REST API allowing us to perform CRUD operations using http requests.

-  AWS s3 supports two types of addressing models:
   1.  path style urls:

       - In this type bucket name comes after the region
       - <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65400893/219932140-1f962556-c325-485e-b5bf-0d78daa1f805.jpg" />

   2.  Virtual hosted-style urls:

       - Virtual hosting is the practice of serving multiple websites from a single web server.
       - Here bucket name is the part of domain name in the URL
       - <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65400893/219932256-289d8925-2124-4070-be3a-e966f8b76511.jpg"/>

#### s3 data management

-  aws s3 supports read-after-write consistency for any request object.

#### Using the command line

- s3 supports two types of commands
   - High level commands
   - low level commands
        - uses s3api command sets

for more detailed info refer to cli notes üëâüèª [here](https://github.com/itzrahulyadav/AWS-notes/tree/main/AWS_CLI/s3)


#### multi-part upload

-  we can upload or copy objects of upto 5GB in a single operation.To upload objects greater than that we can use __aws s3 multi part upload__.

-  <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65400893/219933222-e5de2598-7c97-445c-909d-0b035d625a12.png" width = "400px" height = "300px" />


##### Delete operations

- If versioning is not enabled the objects are deleted permanently.
- If versioning is enabled we can either delete objects permanently or put a delete marker on the specific version.


### cloud data migration services

AWS offers a wide variety of services to transfer your data in and out of the cloud

1.  Online data transfer services
    -  AWS datasync (Moves large amounts of data online between on premises and Amazon S3)
    -  AWS transfer family (Supports SFTP, FTPS)
    -  AWS s3 transfer acceleration (Secure transfers of files over long distances)
    -  AWS kinesis data firehose (Near-real-time analytics with the business intelligence)
    -  AWS kinesis data streams (Continuously captures and stores TBs of data per hour.)
    -  Amazon partner network (Continuously captures and stores TBs of data per hour.)

2.  Offline data transfer services
    -  AWS snowcone
        - smallest member of snow family
        - has 8TB of storage
        - supports edge computing
        - can also use datasync to transfer data using edge computing

    -  AWS snowball
       - AWS Snowball is an edge computing, data migration, and edge storage device that comes in two options: Snowball Edge Storage Optimized and Snowball Edge Compute optimized.
       - storage optimised provides both block and object storage with 40vcpus
       - edge optimised provides 52vcpus and GPU
       
    -  AWS snowmobile
       - AWS Snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS.
       - can transfer upto 100PB of data/truck

 3.  Hybrid data transfer services
     - AWS direct connect
       - AWS Direct Connect is a dedicated network connection from your on-premise data center to AWS.
       - It provides a dedicated connection for higher throughput and secure data transfer without passing through the internet
     - AWS storage gateway
       - can be used to store your on premises data in an existing Amazon S3 bucket. 
       - uses NFS and SMB
       -  You can transfer your data using an AWS File Storage Gateway over the internet or over an AWS Direct Connect connection.
 

### Secure your s3 buckets

-  By default s3 buckets are private and only the account owner can modify or view the buckets.
-  There are following access management features in s3 buckets
     - AWS IAM
     - Bucket Policies
     - Pre-Signed URLs
     - Access control lists

####  Advance s3 security features

-  Block public access
     - It blocks all the public access


Access policies describe who has access to what resouces.These are attached to the resources and are called resource policies.

Resource policies are attached to the resources for example: bucket policies,acls etc
User-based policies are attached to the users for example: an IAM policy or access policies

#### Bucket policies

-  Bucket policies are used to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users access to the bucket and the objects.
-  Bucket policies must have a "principal" key which donates entity (which is an account, user, role, or service) to whom the policy
  is granting access.
  
-  max size limit is 20 kb
